                    This is a wonderful place to hangout, especially for those who like to take a walk by the coast. The recommended time would be at sunset. interesting part of Mumbai. There is no direct access to the water however pleasant place to relax or have a walk.A drive on Marine Drive in the evening affords great night vistas of Mumbai's skyline dotted with lights.. the walkway that adjoins the Sea makes for a pleasant walk and faces the Arabian Sea on one end, It's Awesome. One can spend whole night just enjoying cool breeze siting ideal right there.. </p>

                    Officially it is called Gharapuri, but more famous as Elephanta caves.
                    When the Portuguese took over the island in 1534, they found a huge black rock-cut stone statue of an elephant and the island was accordingly named as elephanta caves.
                    This elephant statue is currently at the zoo in Mumbai
                    There are 7 sculpted caves, 5 Hindu and 2 Buddhist, and except for the main cave, all in
                    A sorry state.
                    They say that these caves were used as Hindu place of worship till 1534, after which the caves suffered severe damages. it could be due to water erosion, also that the Portuguese soldiers used it for target practise.
                    It is now maintained by the Archeological Survey of India. Designated as an UNESCO heritage place in 1987.
                    The central hall has free standing massive square pillars.
                    Has a big carving of three faces of Lord Shiva and beside that, Lord Shiva in various avatars. His marriage to Parvati, him receiving the river Ganga on his head, Ravan lifting Mount Kailas, Ardhanarisvara ( half man, half woman), in dance and Yoga.
                    This island was built between 7-10 century AD. It is situated North East from Mumbai, at a distance of 11 km and 7 km from the shore regular launches leave from the Gateway of India, at Apollo Bunder and is a 40 minute ride away

                    Aamby Valley City is a gated community hence entry is restricted to the property owners at Aamby Valley City. However Aamby Valley City welcomes all Wedding and MICE guests.The ambience and hygiene is amazing, it's a huge property, so I would suggest atleast spending 2 nights at the property. Food at all restaurants is amazing, expensive (obviously bcos it's 5 star standard) but it's absolutely worth every penny. Overall experience was amazing. No regrets or issues at all. Would definitely like to go there again.

                    <p> This movie is about A clumsy, shy teenage girl who discovers that she is the princess of Genovia, a small European state. Thereafter, she must prove to her grandmother that she is worthy of her title. I love the movie and it is suitable for ages 12+. In THE PRINCESS DIARIES, Mia Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway) is a shy 15-year-old who says, "My expectation in life is to be invisible, and I'm good at it." She dreams of dating high school hunk Josh Bryant, and she'd like to be able to get up in front of the class to speak without going to pieces. Her sympathetic mother, an artist, her best friend Lilly (Heather Matarazzo), and her "baby," a beat-up Mustang she's having repaired, keep her going. Just before her 16th birthday, she gets a visit from her grandmother (Julie Andrews), whom she's never met. An even bigger surprise is the reason for the visit: It turns out that Mia's grandmother is the queen of Genovia and her late father was a prince, so that makes her a princess! Mia will have to get some fast princess lessons to get ready for the ball -- that is, if she decides to accept the job, which she's not so sure about. As she says to her mother, "Just in case I'm not enough of a freak already, let's add a tiara!" Things get worse when Lilly feels deserted, and a couple of very public mistakes make Mia feel that she isn't up to the job. But this would not be a fairy tale if everyone didn't live happily ever after, so somehow everyone's wishes come true.</p>

                        Stargirl is a 2020 American jukebox musical romantic drama film based on the novel of the same name by Jerry Spinelli that debuted on Disney+. The film explores the tense emotions, non-conformity and self-expression of teenagers in high school, and the exuberance of first love.

                    </h5>
                    <p> Stargirl — a Disney+ original from Fast Colour director Julia Hart — also serves to illustrate how the genre has moved on, but by stubbornly remaining in the past, at a time when simply being an outsider was cause to be ostracised. Geeky kid Leo (Graham Verchere) finds the source of confidence that he’s always dreamed of having in Stargirl (Grace VanderWaal), but the moment she’s ostracised for her individuality by his classmates (each confined to their own pre-determined cliques), Leo turns his back on her, making what should be a sympathetic protagonist vastly unlikeable on account of his outdated values.

                <p> Anna Sewell’s “Black Beauty” has seen a number of on-screen incarnations since the Silent Era. The last adaptation from 1994 was a video store staple, its amber-colored poster illuminated a gorgeous black horse rearing up, a display of both natural beauty and strength that caught your eye every time you passed it—even if you’ve already seen the movie. It’s no surprise that as memorable as that version was a generation ago, there’s a new adaptation for younger audiences who have yet to learn about the bittersweet saga of what can happen to these gorgeous creatures. It shows you the bond between humans and animals and the cruelty toward horses. It is a heartwarming and emotional movie. </p>

                <p> This remake of 1961's THE PARENT TRAP stars Lindsay Lohan as both Hallie and Annie, twin girls separated at birth who meet up at summer camp and decide to switch places. Their father, Nick (Dennis Quaid), owns a vineyard, and their mother, Elizabeth (Natasha Richardson), designs wedding gowns. Meredith (Elaine Hendrix), their dad's scheming girlfriend, hopes to marry Nick for his money, so Hallie and Annie set out to get their parents back together, and while they're at it, make life miserable for Meredith.This is a delightful remake of the Hayley Mills classic. Lohan is utterly adorable and does a masterful job of creating two separate characters, each of whom spends a large part of the movie impersonating the other.</p>

However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.

          <p class="p_modal">Meg isn't thrilled when she gets stuck sharing a bedroom with her older sister Molly. The two of them couldn't be more different, and it's hard for Meg to hide her resentment of Molly's beauty and easy popularity. But now that the family has moved to a small house in the country, Meg has a lot to accept.
          just as the sisters begin to adjust to their new home, Meg feels that Molly is starting up again by being a real nuisance. But Molly's constant grouchiness, changing appearance, and other complaints are not just part of a new mood. And the day Molly is rushed to the hospital, Meg has to accept that there is something terribly wrong with her sister. That's the day Meg's world changes forever. Is it too late for Meg to show her true feelings?<br>
